In the spirit of 3D-Printed object creation, I thought it would be a helpful resource to compile all component dimensions in a single location. Hopefully with this information we'll see an influx of 3D models and innovative solutions to some of the pain-points we face when playing (and storing) the game. I'm traveling this week and don't have access to the components, but I've compiled the list of dimensions I was able to find across various forums. There's still a good deal outstanding. Perhaps you with accurate measuring tools could help fill in the gaps?

edit: A HUGE thanks to /r/mxzf and their work/comment here with a majority of the measurements. With this we finally have a nearly 100% complete list of the dimensions of all non-ship components in X-Wing. I hope this is an encouragement to those of you interested in 3D modelling. If you're interested in getting started, I strongly recommend trying TinkerCAD here where you can learn to make 3D models for all sorts of things. Good luck everyone, and make sure to post your creations here!
